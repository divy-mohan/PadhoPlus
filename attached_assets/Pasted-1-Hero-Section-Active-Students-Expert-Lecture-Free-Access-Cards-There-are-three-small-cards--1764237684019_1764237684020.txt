1. Hero Section (Active Students / Expert Lecture / Free Access Cards)

There are three small cards: Active Students, Expert Lecture, Free Access.

On mobile, I want all three cards to sit side-by-side in a single horizontal row (like 3 columns in one row).

Use proper Bootstrap grid classes (e.g., col-4, col-md-4, etc.) or a flexbox layout so they stay aligned horizontally and look good both on mobile and desktop.

The text inside these cards should not be cut off on mobile. Reduce font-size where needed, allow wrapping, and add appropriate padding so everything is clearly visible.

Add Bootstrap Icons inside each card (e.g., an icon related to users, video/lecture, and unlock/free access). Place the icons nicely aligned with the heading.

2. “Why Choose” Section

This section has multiple cards explaining “Why Choose [Platform]”.

On mobile, I want at least 2 cards per row in one horizontal area.

Use Bootstrap grid (e.g., col-6 on mobile, maybe col-md-4 or col-md-3 on larger screens) so that:

Cards are evenly spaced.

Text remains readable and not squished.

Adjust padding/margins so the section looks clean and balanced on both mobile and desktop.

3. “How It Works” Section

On desktop, all steps are in a single horizontal row.

I want the same order and alignment maintained on mobile, but still fully responsive.

Arrange all steps in one horizontal row with proper alignment and equal spacing. On smaller screens, this can be done either with:

Responsive columns that wrap nicely, or

A horizontal scroll (overflow-x) row that keeps all steps in one line.

Ensure perfect alignment and synchronization (icons, step numbers, step titles, and descriptions should be consistently aligned across all steps).

4. “Exam Category” Section (NEET / IIT-JEE / Foundation)

We have categories like NEET, and under each category we show multiple exams.

I want this list of exams to be horizontally scrollable under each category on mobile:

Use a container with overflow-x: auto; white-space: nowrap; or equivalent.

Each exam card/item should align horizontally and be easy to scroll with a swipe.

Do the same horizontal scroll behavior for:

IIT-JEE

Foundation

Make sure scrollbars look neat or are minimal; the focus is on a smooth horizontal scroll experience for exam cards.

5. “Why Students Choose Us” Section

There are three main (big) cards, and under each big card there are smaller cards related to that big card.

I want:

All three big cards in the same horizontal row (responsive grid).

For each big card, its small cards should be aligned in the same direction:

One big card + one small card in the same horizontal row.

These big+small pairs should be vertically aligned when stacked.

All cards of the same category should line up neatly horizontally.

Use Bootstrap grid or flexbox to:

Keep the layout aligned and consistent on desktop.

Make sure on mobile it’s still clear which small card belongs to which big card, without breaking alignment.

6. “What You Get In Every Batch” Section

This section has multiple feature/benefit cards.

I want either 3 cards per row or at least 2 cards per row on mobile (not one per row unless the screen is extremely small).

Use responsive Bootstrap grid classes (e.g., col-6 on small screens, col-md-4 on medium, etc.) so:

Cards are neatly aligned.

Text and icons are readable and not overflowing.

7. “Success Stories” Section

This section contains success story cards/testimonials.

I want these to be displayed as a horizontal scroll carousel/list on mobile:

Place all success story cards inside a horizontally scrollable container (overflow-x: auto).

Each card should be clearly visible, with some spacing between cards.

Make sure cards don’t get cut off and swiping left/right feels smooth.
